h2o-so2:
	900x h2o and 50x so2 - represent a water phase with a gas of SO2 (at STP, 1 mol/L) above the surface.
	Simulated at 300K
	1.0 fs timesteps, equil coords pulled out every 250 steps for 1ns in order to watch the so2 uptake onto the surface

h2o-so2.cold:
	Same as h2o-so2 system, but simulated at 273K
