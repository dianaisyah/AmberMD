Published values for sigma (the lennard jones non-bond radius) can not be used directly in Amber. Typically the conversion from the C12 + C6 parameters looks like:

	sigma = (C12/r^12 - C6/r^6) ^ (1/6)

however, amber calculates non-bonded parameters by using 1/2 the radius/distance between particles, with the following relation:

	sigma_amber = (2*C12/r^12 - C6/r^6) ^ (1/6) / 2

note the added multiple of 2 (e.g. 2*C12) and the division by two of the entire value to represent half the distance

Thus, sigma_amber = 2^(1/6) / 2 * sigma_other
